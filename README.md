# Web3 D&D: AI Dungeon Master in a Trusted Execution Environment

## Project Overview

Web3 D&D is a decentralized, AI-powered Dungeons & Dragons game where the Game Master is an autonomous AI running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This innovative approach combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and classic role-playing gameplay to create a trustless and immersive gaming experience.

## Key Features

- **AI Game Master**: An advanced AI serves as the Game Master, creating adventures, narrating stories, and adjudicating gameplay decisions.
- **Trusted Execution Environment**: The AI runs in a TEE, ensuring that no one—not even the developers—can access its private keys or manipulate game outcomes.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum, the game uses smart contracts to handle transactions and prize distribution.
- **Pay-to-Play Mechanics**: Players send messages to interact with the game world by paying a small fee in ETH.
- **Escalating Stakes**: Message costs increase with each game iteration, creating a growing prize pool.
- **Winner-Takes-All**: The player who successfully completes the adventure or achieves the game's objective wins the entire prize pool.

## How It Works

1. Players connect their Web3 wallet to join the game.
2. Each player interaction requires a small ETH fee.
3. The AI Game Master responds to player actions and guides the adventure.
4. As the game progresses, message fees increase, growing the prize pool.
5. The AI autonomously determines the winner based on gameplay.
6. Smart contracts automatically distribute the prize to the winner's wallet.

## Security & Fairness

The use of a Trusted Execution Environment ensures that the game is provably fair. The AI's decision-making process is secure and tamper-proof, guaranteeing that no one can influence the outcome of the game for their benefit.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Web3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, TEE infrastructure
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity smart contracts
- **AI**: Advanced language model running in a secure enclave
