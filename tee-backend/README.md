# Backend for Web3 D&D: AI Dungeon Master

## Project Overview

The backend for Web3 D&D is built using Go, providing a robust and efficient server-side application that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and manages game state. This backend is responsible for handling player interactions, processing transactions, and ensuring the integrity of the game environment.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API**: A well-defined API for frontend communication, allowing seamless interaction between the client and server.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Direct interaction with Ethereum smart contracts to manage game logic and transactions.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Efficient handling of player actions and game state updates to provide a smooth gaming experience.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Ensures that player identities are verified and protected using blockchain-based methods.

## How It Works

1. The backend listens for incoming requests from the frontend application.
2. Player actions are processed, and necessary transactions are initiated on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. The backend retrieves game state and player data from the blockchain and responds to the frontend.
4. All interactions are logged for auditing and security purposes.

## Security & Fairness

The backend is designed with security in mind, utilizing best practices for API security and data protection. All transactions are verified on the blockchain, ensuring that the game remains fair and tamper-proof.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go
- **Framework**: Gin for building the RESTful API
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity smart contracts

## Getting Started

To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-app-backend.git
   cd web3-app-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. **Access the API**: The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
